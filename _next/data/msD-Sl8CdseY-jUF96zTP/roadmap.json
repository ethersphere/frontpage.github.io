They benefit from dashboards monitoring vital metrics displaying the node's operational health. Developers can rely on help provided in dev channels.</p>"},{"title":"Operators","content":"<p>Node operators are sufficiently incentivised to contribute their bandwidth and storage space. Time-based allowance is calibrated so that clients paying for bandwidth will get reasonable service. As for storage, Postage Stamp revenue is redistributed to storer nodes directly in an efficient way without the need for storage contributors to stake their tokens.</p>"},{"title":"Collaborators","content":"<p>Alternative client development is supported by consolidated and structured specifications of the DISC protocols and client strategies. High level standards and APIs are cleared up and documented. Integration, multiclient testing environment and quality assurance tools are provided. Ecosystem projects are provided with grants and fellowships.</p>"},{"title":"Community","content":"<p>The Swarm Foundation aims to assist as much as it can in providing scaffoldings to the community to support their own agenda involving Swarm. It encourages autonomous, independent and permissionless communities to take further ownership over the protocol and its usages.</p>"},{"title":"Commons","content":"<p>The Foundation subsidises efforts to make large datasets of public interest available through Swarm.</p>"}]}}]}}]},"__N_SSG":true}

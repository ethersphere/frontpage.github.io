						<div id="how-often-should-i-cash-out-my-cheques" class="collapse answer">
							<p>Cashing out your cheques once a day should be sufficient. Cashing out cheques more frequently puts stress on the Goerli blockchain and is not advised.</p>

						<div id="what-do-you-need-to-do-to-get-your-hands-on-these-bzz-tokens" class="collapse answer">
							<p>This one is simple. You have to install and run your Bee node. You will need a working, well-connected, and data-rich Bee node to increase your chances of getting the BZZ. The more you contribute to the network, the more chances you have to get BZZ.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="question more" data-toggle="collapse" href="#which-nodes-will-be-eligible-for-the-airdrop" moretext="Which nodes will be eligible for the airdrop?">Which nodes will be eligible for the airdrop?</div>
						<div id="which-nodes-will-be-eligible-for-the-airdrop" class="collapse answer">
							<p>The nodes that will be eligible for BZZ tokens are those that have proven exchanged bandwidth with what we call trusted “Queen Bee nodes”.</p>
							<p>There are going to be exactly 35 queen nodes in the network and nobody (not even the team members) will know which those nodes are. That will be decided at the very end of the airdrop.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="question more" data-toggle="collapse" href="#what-is-the-proof-of-data-exchange-between-your-node-and-the-queen-node" moretext="What is the proof of data exchange between your node and the queen node?">What is the proof of data exchange between your node and the queen node?</div>
						<div id="what-is-the-proof-of-data-exchange-between-your-node-and-the-queen-node" class="collapse answer">
							<p>The proof of data exchange between your node and queen node is the value of the cheques you cashed from the queen node (qBZZ).</p>
							<p>At the end of the airdrop, we will simply run a script and collect all the value of the cheques originating from queen nodes which are cashed out. The more cashed out qBZZ cheques you received, the more BZZ tokens you will receive. It’s not the number of cheques, but the gBZZ value in the exchange. You only need to cash out cheques every once (we advice doing cashouts on a regular basis, like once a week) in a while and make sure you cash out all of them just before the airdrop ends and we switch to mainnet.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="question more" data-toggle="collapse" href="#how-many-tokens-will-you-get" moretext="How many tokens will you get?">How many tokens will you get?</div>
						<div id="how-many-tokens-will-you-get" class="collapse answer">
							<p>We are handing out exactly 1,000,000 BZZ tokens. The value of qBZZ is not yet determined, as this depends on the network traffic. The total value of BZZ tokens you will get depends on the share of the qBZZ you received over the total number of qBZZ handed out.</p>
							<p>For the airdrop, the value of cashed-out cheques matter, not the number of cashed-out cheques.</p>
							<p><strong>Example: </strong><br>At the end of the airdrop, 500k worth of qBZZ cheques were collected from all the nodes in the network. In this case, one qBZZ token is worth: 1M BZZ divided by 500k = 2 BZZ tokens per qBZZ token.</p>
							<p>So, if your node collected 50 worth of qBZZ cheques, you would receive 50 x 2BZZ = 100 BZZ tokens. If you ran 3 nodes and they collected 50 worth of qBZZ cheques each, then that is 300 BZZ from the airdrop.</p>

							<p>We will announce the airdrop end date so you will have time to cashout.</p>
							<p>We advice doing cashouts on a regular basis, like once a week > if your node has crashed and you have lost the keypair, you won’t be able to recover the cheques.</p>

						<div id="what-should-i-do-with-received-cheques-before-the-end-of-the-airdrop" class="collapse answer">
							<p>This is important — as the airdrop concludes, you will need to cash out your qBZZ cheques. Without this, you will not receive your BZZ tokens once we hit mainnet.</p>

							<p>We’re still deciding on the exact mechanism. There will be very clear communication about this.</p>

							<p>We highly recommend running your Bee node together with Bee-Clef.</p>
							<p>If you are running Bee together with the Bee-Clef, you can type in the command line `bee-clef-keys` and that will store the .JSON file into your home folder and put the password in your clipboard.</p>

							<p>Yes, if you have the private key of the owner of the cheque book that cashed the checks.</p>

							<p>You can use Bee Dashboard which can help you setup your Bee node, monitor its status and perform actions like uploading files and cashing out cheques.</p>
							<p>You can also check out a few interesting tools created by our wonderful community members.</p>

							<p>If you are on Discord, you can go to #faucet-request channel and type sprinkle “your node address”, and your address will be funded.</p>
							<p>You can also get your gBZZ using <a href="https://bzz.ethswarm.org/">Bzzaar</a>, or our legacy faucet at <a href="https://faucet.ethswarm.org">https://faucet.ethswarm.org</a>.</p>

						<div id="how-to-use-the-bzzaar-to-get-gbzz-for-bee" class="collapse answer">
							<p>For more detailed instructions, please check “fund your node on the docs”</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Set up a MetaMask account on the Goerli test chain</li>
								<li>Go to the bzzaar via the link as provided in your bee logs `https://bzz.ethswarm.org/?transaction=buy&amount=10&slippage=30&receiver=`</li>
								<li>Connect the Bzzaar to your MetaMask wallet on the Goerli test chain (upper right)</li>
								<li>Use the get g-eth button on the bzzaar to get g-eth on your node and MetaMask account</li>
								<li>Press the Exchange button to mint gBzz into the node’s account</li>
								<li>Approve the transaction in your MetaMask</li>
								<li>Wait a bit and the node should be able to proceed.</li>
							</ol>
							<p>This can take a couple of minutes; check the faucet address on Etherscan and look for the transactions to your addresses.</p>

							<p>You may need to reconnect your wallet to see your balance increase once the transaction is completed.</p>

						<div id="what-are-geth-and-gbzz" class="collapse answer">
							<p>gEth is the native token on the goerli test blockchain. gBZZ is the BZZ token also on the goerli test blockchain. You get gETH from goerli faucets and it is required for deploying the chequebook contract (once only), depositing gBZZ into the chequebook, and for cashing chequeslater. gBZZ is the Bee currency and is collected or paid for transferring data in the network and for storage when postage stamps get released.</p>

						<div id="how-much-network-traffic-does-one-node-consume-per-day" class="collapse answer">

							<p>Tokens will be released in two batches. The first batch of tokens will be distributed on 21 June 2021 to all the allocations except for the Coinlist purchasers and the airdrop. For regulatory reasons, tokens purchased in the CoinList sale as well as those related to the airdrop will be made available on or around 2 August 2021.</p>

							<p>3,708,125 tokens are going to be minted, to match the circulating supply according to the bonding curve at the price point of 1.92 per token. The smart contract will be released in the next few days, after audits are completed. This bonding curve contract can mint and redeem tokens to match supply and demand.</p>

							<p>All tokens on the Swarm network, other than the CoinList sale tokens and airdrop tokens, will be distributed on June 21 2021. For regulatory reasons, tokens acquired in the CoinList sale will be distributed on or around August 2 2021.</p> 

<p>The Swarm project belongs to the cypherpunk movement. As a result, Swarm has strong principles. One of those is believing in the absence of lockups or any other unnecessary restriction of freedom, within the bounds of regulatory possibilities. </p>

<p>P2p storage and messaging predates blockchain. Swarm started in the first days of Ethereum as part of the original “world computer” vision. The project is the result of years of research and work by the Ethereum Foundation, the Swarm Foundation, and teams and individuals across the ecosystem and the community. Even so, this is just the beginning of the road towards a fully decentralised and fair web.</p>

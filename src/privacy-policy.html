          <h3>Mautic</h3>
          <h4> Mautic (<a class="more" href="https://www.mautic.org/" target="_blank">https://www.mautic.org/</a>) is a self-hosted open source marketing automation service which organizes and analyzes the distribution of newsletters. 
          <br> <br>
             
            We use Mautic to analyze our newsletter campaigns. This allows us to determine if a newsletter message has been opened and which links you click on. In addition, technical information is collected (e.g. time of retrieval, IP address ...). This information is used exclusively for the statistical analysis of our newsletter campaigns. The results of these analyses can be used to better tailor future newsletters to your interests.
            If you do not want your usage of the newsletter to be analyzed by Mautic, you will have to unsubscribe from the newsletter. For this purpose, we provide a link in every newsletter we send. 

            <br> <br>
            Data processing is based on Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR. You may revoke your consent at any time by unsubscribing to the newsletter. The data processed before we receive your request may still be legally processed.
            <br> <br>
            The data provided when registering for the newsletter will be used to distribute the newsletter until you cancel your subscription when said data will be deleted from our servers. Data we have stored for other purposes (e.g. email addresses for the members area) remains unaffected.
            <br> <br>
            For details, see the Mautic privacy policy at:
             <a class="more" href="https://www.mautic.org/privacy-policy/" target="_blank">https://www.mautic.org/privacy-policy/</a>
             <br> <br>
            <h3>Completion of a data processing agreement</h3>
            We host Mautic on servers in Switzerland, so that all the data and analysis remains with us and is not passed on. The servers are provided by Exoscale and their Data Protection Agreement can be viewed at: <a class="more" href="https://www.exoscale.com/dpa/" target="_blank">https://www.exoscale.com/dpa/</a>

          <h3>Matomo</h3>
          <h4>
            <a class="more" href="www.ethswarm.org" target="_blank">www.ethswarm.org</a> website uses the open source and self-hosted web analysis service Matomo. Matomo uses technologies that make it possible to recognize the user across multiple pages with the aim of analyzing the user patterns (e.g. cookies or device fingerprinting). The information recorded by Matomo about the use of this website will be stored on our server. Prior to archiving, the IP address will first be anonymized.
            <br><br>
            Through Matomo, we are able to collect and analyze data on the use of our website by website visitors. This enables us to find out, for instance, when which page views occurred and from which region they came. In addition, we collect various log files (e.g. IP address, referrer, browser and operating system used) and can measure whether our website visitors perform certain actions (e.g. clicks, etc.).
            <br><br>
            The use of this analysis tool is based on Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. f GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in the analysis of user patterns, in order to optimize the operator’s web offerings and advertising. If a corresponding agreement has been requested (e.g. an agreement to the storage of cookies), the processing takes place exclusively on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR; the agreement can be revoked at any time.
            <br><br>
            <h3>Completion of a data processing agreement</h3>
            We host Matomo on servers in Switzerland, so that all the data and analysis remains with us and is not passed on.

          <h3>Google Web Fonts</h3>
          <h4>
            For uniform representation of fonts, this page uses web fonts provided by Google. When you open a page, your browser loads the required web fonts into your browser cache to display texts and fonts correctly.
            <br><br>
            When you call up a page of our website that contains a social plugin, your browser makes a direct connection with Google servers. Google thus becomes aware that our web page was accessed via your IP address. The use of Google Web fonts is done in the interest of a uniform and attractive presentation of our website. This constitutes a legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR.
            <br><br>
            If your browser does not support web fonts, a standard font is used by your computer.
            <br><br>

          <ul>
            <li>to object to us using or processing your personal information where we use or process it in order to carry out a task in the public interest, where we do so in the exercise of official authority or for our legitimate interests, including ‘profiling’ (i.e. predicting your behaviour based on your personal information) based on any of these purposes; and</li>
            <li>to object to us processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes (including any automated evaluation we make about you or any of your characteristics as a person, to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing).</li>

          You may also exercise your right to object to us using or processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes by:
          <ul>
            <li>clicking the unsubscribe link contained at the bottom of any marketing email we send to you and following the instructions which appear in your browser following your clicking on that link; or

          Whenever you object to direct marketing from us by a different communication method to that of the marketing communications you have received from us, you must provide us with your name and sufficient information to enable us to identify you in relation to the communications you have received (for example, if you have received text messages from us and you wish to unsubscribe by email, we may need you to provide us with your phone number in that email).
